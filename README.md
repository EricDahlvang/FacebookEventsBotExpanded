# Concepts introduced in this sample

This is a Fork of the [23.facebook-events](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/23.facebook-events) sample and expanded to include Facebook Handover Protocol event handling, including passing thread control to a secondary bot.

This sample shows how to integrate and consume Facebook specific payloads, such as postbacks, quick replies, echos and optin events. 

Since Bot Framework supports multiple Facebook pages for a single bot, we also show how to know the page to which the message was sent, so developers can have custom behavior per page.

### Install .NET Core and CLI Tooling
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 2.1
	```bash
	# determine dotnet version
	dotnet --version
	```
- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Install the latest version of the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) tool. Version 2.0.54 or higher.

# To try this sample
- In a terminal, navigate to `23.facebook-events`
    ```bash
    # change into project folder
	cd 23.facebook-events
    ```
- Run the bot from a terminal or from Visual Studio, choose option A or B.

	A) From a terminal
	```bash
	# run the bot
	dotnet run
	```

	B) Or from Visual Studio
	- Launch Visual Studio
	- File -> Open -> Project/Solution
	- Navigate to `23.facebook-events` folder
	- Select `Facebook-Events-Bot.csproj` file
	- Press `F5` to run the project

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

### Enable Facebook Channel

The final step to test Facebook-specific features is to publish your bot for the Facebook channel. The Bot Framework makes this very easy,
and the detailed steps are explained in the [Bot Framework Channel Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-facebook?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).

## Deploy the bot to Azure
